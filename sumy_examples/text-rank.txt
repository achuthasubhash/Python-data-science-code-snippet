Learn data science and you could find yourself working in this promising, well-compensated field.
But even if you’re not interested in becoming a data scientist, learning data skills and improving your data literacy can pay big dividends in your current career.
So how do you start to learn data science?
If I had started learning data science this way, I never would have kept going.
If you want to learn data science or just pick up some data science skills, your first goal should be to learn to love data.
Because I was learning to love data, I was motivated to learn anything I needed to make my programs better.
By working on projects, you gain skills that are immediately applicable and useful, because real-world data scientists have to see data science projects through from start to finish, and most of that work is in fundamentals like cleaning and managing the data.
It’s not unusual for a data scientist to move from team to team as they work on answering data questions for different arms of the company, so being able to collaborate may be more important for data scientists than almost anyone else!
Based on job postings and what data scientists report doing at work, the most fundamental data science skills are:
For more information on these, you can take a look at our Data Scientist learning path , which is designed to teach all of the important data science skills for Python learners.
