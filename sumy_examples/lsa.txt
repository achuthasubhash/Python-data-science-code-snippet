The response to this question tends to be a long list of courses to take and books to read, starting with linear algebra or statistics.
You need something that will motivate you to keep learning, even when it’s midnight, the formulas are starting to look blurry, and you’re wondering if neural networks will ever make sense.
I then created some indicators, like average price over the past few days, and used them to predict the future (no real algorithms here, just technical analysis).
More important, if you’re not actively applying what you learn, your studies won’t prepare you to do actual data science work.
Programs and platforms that offer certifications can still be a great investment, but it’s important to keep in mind that their value lies in the skills they can teach you.
Universities can also be subject to institutional inertia and slow to adapt, so you can end up wasting time studying older technologies that aren’t as relevant in the current business environment.
Thankfully, there are many, many examples of people who’ve successfully learned data science on their own, and reached a high level in the industry without needing a specialized degree.
Programming in Python or R (either works) Fluency with popular packages and workflows for data science tasks in your language of choice.
If you choose Python, for example, you should be familiar with libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib or Plotly, and scikit-learn, and you should be comfortable with cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data using them.
From there, you can dig deeper into specializations like Natural Language Processing, Image Classification, Deep Learning, and a wide variety of other options depending on your interests.
