But even if you’re not interested in becoming a data scientist, learning data skills and improving your data literacy can pay big dividends in your current career.
The response to this question tends to be a long list of courses to take and books to read, starting with linear algebra or statistics.
Learning about machine learning, neural networks, image recognition, and other cutting-edge techniques is important.
If you know linear regression, k-means clustering, and logistic regression well, can explain and interpret their results, and can actually complete a project from start to finish with them, you’ll be much more employable than if you know every single algorithm, but can’t use them.
By working on projects, you gain skills that are immediately applicable and useful, because real-world data scientists have to see data science projects through from start to finish, and most of that work is in fundamentals like cleaning and managing the data.
Another technique (and this was my technique) was to find a deep problem, predicting the stock market, that could be broken down into small steps.

Data scientists often work as part of a team, and lone data scientists at smaller companies will typically work together with other teams at their company to solve specific problems.
Message people who write interesting data analysis blogs seeing if you can collaborate.
Based on job postings and what data scientists report doing at work, the most fundamental data science skills are:
