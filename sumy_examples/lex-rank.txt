So how do you start to learn data science?
If I had started learning data science this way, I never would have kept going.
I learn when I’m motivated, and when I know why I’m learning something.
There’s some science behind this, too.
If you want to learn data science or just pick up some data science skills, your first goal should be to learn to love data.
But it’s important to find that thing that makes you want to learn.
By working on projects, you gain skills that are immediately applicable and useful, because real-world data scientists have to see data science projects through from start to finish, and most of that work is in fundamentals like cleaning and managing the data.
And so on, until the algorithm worked well.
Find people to work with at meetups.
For more information on these, you can take a look at our Data Scientist learning path , which is designed to teach all of the important data science skills for Python learners.
